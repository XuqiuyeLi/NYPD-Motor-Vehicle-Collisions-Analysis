# NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Analysis

### Summary
In this project you will provide a tool for extraction of certain type of information about motor vehicle collisions in New York City. The New York Police Department (NYPD) provides data regarding all motor vehicle collisions that occur on streets on NYC. This data can be downloaded from NYC Open Data website at
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95.
To simplify your task, the course website has a listing of several preprocessed files that contain the data for different time periods and locations. 

Your program should run with one of those files as the input and extract some interesting information (details below) from it:
weâ€™ll look for detail reports for particular (user specified) zip codes and particular time frames.

The program that you write has to be command line based (no graphical interface).


### Objectives

The goal of this programming project is for you to master (or at least get practice on) the following tasks:
 working with multi-file programs
 reading data from input files
 using command line arguments
 working with large data sets
 implementing an AVL tree
 writing complex code projects
